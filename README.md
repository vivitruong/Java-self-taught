### Whole Numbers

The variable examples above use the int data type. int is the name of the integer data type. An integer represents a whole number, no decimals, that can be positive or negative. Whole number data types use different amounts of memory. An integer uses 32 bits. That means there are 4,294,967,296 integers. The maximum integer value is 2,147,483,647. The minimum is -2,147,483,648. When we include zero 0 as a value, we account for all 4,294,967,296 integers.

The long data type represents a whole number that can be positive or negative. It uses 64 bits. That's a lot bigger than an integer -- 4,294,967,296 times as big, in fact. short and byte follow the same rules. They're whole numbers that can be positive or negative. short uses 16 bits. byte uses 8 bits.
byte b = 56;
short s = 1024;
int i = 314;
long lng = -256;
